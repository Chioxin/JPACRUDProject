This project was about creating a single tabled database using MySQL Workbench, and creating a Spring Boot web page to support that database. The task was to make sure the web page could search for, update, add, and destroy items in the database. This particular database has to do with ships from EVE Online!

### My Focuses

Knowing that I am good on the back end, during my stretch goals I attempted to look more into CSS, Bootstrap, and HTML to try and produce a better looking front end as that's my weak point. Note that there were only 2 days to get this project done. One day was spent entirely on back end, and the next was spent on the front end. I learned a lot about Bootstrap and CSS together. I'm quite proud of the Nav Bar, as well as the way I display and list ships if searching by a group.
